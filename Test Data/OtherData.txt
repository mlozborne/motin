lab: length of outside circuit?????????

lab train timing for one full circuit
Speed          EC  inch/sec       E6C  inch/sec    
100%          :56    ???          :56    ???
 75%         1:18                1:22
 50%         1:56                2:06
 25%         4:28
 where EC = engine + car and E6C = engine + 6car   (caboose is a car)

Stopping distance and time in lab
Speed       gradual     abrupt    time
100%          46"        8"       ???         use this time in TrainTask for BW, BH, BD
75%                      4"       ???
50%           15"        2"       ???
