HOW THE CONTROLLER SHOULD BEHAVE IN RESPONSE TO:

OPC_LOCO_ADR received
Controller needs to be able to respond to this when it is sent by a throttle attached to the
controller. This message should be discarded when sent by a throttle attached to the locobuffer/simulator.

OPC_SL_RD_DATA and OPC_LONG_ACK sent by controller
in response to OPC_LOC_ADR from a throttle attached to the controller

OPC_SL_RD_DATA received from railroad/simulator
Controller must make sure that this is being received in response to OPC_LOCO_ADR  sent by the controller
and not in response to OPC_LOCO_ADR sent by a throttle. This can be done by matching the address field in 
this instruction to the address field in OPC_LOCO_ADR.

OPC_MOVE_SLOTS 
Ignore this one.
